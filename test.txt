Donald Trump has retweeted three inflammatory videos from a British far-right group.
The first tweet from Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, claims to show a Muslim migrant attacking a man on crutches.
This was followed by two more videos of people Ms Fransen claims to be Muslim.
Responding to Mr Trump's posts, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said it was "wrong for the president to have done this".
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mrs May and other world leaders knew that "these are real threats that we have to talk about".
"Whether it's a real video, the threat is real," she said.
"I think it's important to talk about national security and national security threats. The president sees different things to be national security threats, and he sees having strong borders as being one of the things that helps protect people in this country from some real threats that we face."
Britain First was founded in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party.
A McDonald's employee has been arrested in the US state of Florida on suspicion of being a serial killer.
Howell Emanuel Donaldson III is accused of randomly killing four people between 9 October and 14 November in Tampa.
The 24-year-old was detained on Tuesday afternoon at a branch of the burger restaurant where he had reportedly worked for two months.
He had asked a manager to hold on to his loaded 9mm handgun, the Tampa Bay Times reports.
Police say the suspect had "expressed his intention to leave the state".

Memorials in honour of the victims have appeared throughout parts of Tampa
Another McDonald's employee noticed a police officer filling out paperwork in the restaurant, and urged her manager to tell the officer about the gun.
Mobile phone records indicate Mr Donaldson was in the area of three of the murders, according to a sworn police affidavit.
He admitted legally purchasing the pistol on 3 October, say police.
Investigators say the Glock handgun has been tested and matches bullet shell casings found at the murder scenes.
Police say that clothing found during a search of Mr Donaldson's car looks like that worn by a man seen on homeowners' CCTV footage near the crime locations.
They add that the clothes appeared to have been stained by blood.
Gun background checks soar on Black Friday
The killings left many residents of Tampa's working-class neighbourhood of Seminole Heights afraid to venture outside after dark.
Police accompanied students to bus stops, while protesters held reclaim-the-streets demonstrations.
All four victims were either boarding or disembarking from a bus at the time they were shot:
Benjamin Mitchell, 22, a musician, was shot dead on 9 October while waiting at a bus stop
Monica Hoffa, 32, a waitress, was gunned down on 11 October while walking to meet a friend
Anthony Naiboa, 20, a mild autism sufferer, was fatally shot on 19 October while walking home from work
Ronald Felton, 60, a construction worker was killed on 14 November
Mayor Bob Buckhorn told a news conference after the arrest: "Fifty-one days ago, I said this was a struggle between good and evil.
"Well tonight, goodness has won. Tonight, in the battle between darkness and light, light has won."
Florida Governor Rick Scott is due to visit police in Tampa to thank police for the investigation.
"In Florida, we have absolutely zero tolerance for this type of evil behaviour," he said, vowing justice for the victims.
Police believe the gunman chose his victims at random and a motive is still unclear.
The FBI helped police in the investigation.
Matt Lauer, one of the most famous TV news anchors in the US, has been fired by NBC over an allegation of sexual misconduct.
NBC said: "On Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behaviour in the workplace by Matt Lauer.
"As a result, we've decided to terminate his employment."
Lauer co-hosts The Today Show. NBC said it had "reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident".
In another bombshell, one of the most beloved voices on US public radio, Garrison Keillor, was fired.
Minnesota Public Radio said an individual who worked with Keillor on his variety show, A Prairie Home Companion, had accused him of inappropriate behaviour.
There was no immediate statement from Minnesota Public Radio about The Writer's Almanac host's statement to AP news agency.
Of the Matt Lauer allegations, NBC News chairman Andy Lack said it was the first complaint about their star anchorman's behaviour in his time there, more than 20 years.
But Mr Lack added it represented a "clear violation of our company's standards".
Last year, Lauer signed a new contract with the network worth a reported $20m (Â£15m) per year.
As well as fronting the morning show, he was chosen to moderate an election debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And he has conducted high-profile interviews, such as the one in which Charlie Sheen confirmed he is living with HIV in 2015.
Why so many sexual harassment cases in US, not UK?
In an emotional video, Today co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb said they were "heartbroken".
"As I'm sure you can imagine we are devastated and are still processing all of this," Guthrie said.

"I'm heartbroken for Matt - he is my dear, dear friend and my partner and he has been loved by many people here.
"And I'm heartbroken for the brave colleague who came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own stories to tell."
Workplaces 'must be safe'
She added: "This reckoning that so many organisations have been going through is important, it's long overdue and it must result in workplaces where all women - all people - feel safe and respected."
Lauer's agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The New York Times quoted lawyer Ari Wilkenfeld as saying he was representing the woman who had made the complaint and that they met NBC legal and HR staff on Monday, for an interview that lasted several hours.
The US president posted his response to Lauer's sacking on Twitter.
Lauer's departure comes two weeks after NBC executive Matt Zimmerman, who was reported to have worked closely with Lauer, was fired after allegations of inappropriate behaviour.
Last October, Billy Bush left The Today Show after a tape emerged of him making lewd comments with Donald Trump in 2005.
Last week, CBS sacked Charlie Rose, one of its leading anchors, amid allegations of sexual misconduct. In April, Fox News sacked its best-known presenter, Bill O'Reilly.
